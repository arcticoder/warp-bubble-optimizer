# Risk Register (Soliton and EM-Plasma Control)

- Metamaterial amplification factor lower than expected
  - Impact: energy budget shortfall; higher P_peak
  - Mitigation: UQ validation; design guardbands; alternative materials
- Laser coherence reduction below 100Ã— target
  - Impact: increased energy draw; thermal margins exceeded
  - Mitigation: injection locking and phase conjugation trials; redundancy
- Sensor noise degrades closed-loop stability margin
  - Impact: < 6 dB margin; risk of desynchronization
  - Mitigation: sensor fusion; bandwidth tuning; noise budgeting
- Coil hysteresis and nonlinearity
  - Impact: tracking error; envelope distortion
  - Mitigation: calibration; linearization tables; derating
- Plasma ionization/temperature off-nominal
  - Impact: dispersion/absorption; reduced amplification
  - Mitigation: diagnostics; real-time adjustments; operating windows
