# Safety checklist v0.9

- Pre-ignition: interlocks armed, emergency stop tested, comms nominal
- Thermal: heatsinks < limit, coolant flow OK, thermal cameras online
- Plasma: density in window, ionization stable, no arcing
- Coils: insulation resistance > threshold, current sensors calibrated
- Lasers: shutters closed until arm, injection-locking ready
- Abort criteria: overshoot > 5%, temp > limit, phase jitter > budget
- Quench: ramp-down plan verified, dump resistor path validated
